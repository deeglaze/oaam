;; Addresses in abstract interpretation change with varying frequency.
;; Comparing two heaps can be expensive, so if we can partition out slow-change
;; from fast-change, we can be reasonably sure that slowly changing heaps
;; will compare positively more often. Indeed they could have pointer equality
;; with much higher probability. We expect most addresses to be slow-changing.

;; Fast-changing addresses we expect to be less abundant, and thus the fast-changing
;; heaps would be smaller and more amenable to computational scrutiny.
;; The lower dimensionality of the heap could also help with spatial indexing to
;; find heaps that are few changes different from a given one.

;; A spectral heap is split along a given spectrum of variability of each region.
;; Variability is tract by the statistics of the heap
