What are the specs for the benchmark machine?

Which benchmarks were also evaluated in Soft Typing paper?

Look at the Jagannathan and Weeks paper and relate it in related work
section.

The CLU citation is missing some important bits.

The psuedoknot citation has bad characters in it.

Did Ian implement GC?

Need Cousot '79 citation.

FUCK ME:
$ racket max-mins.rkt

(Consequently, the evaluation table is incomplete.)

Picture worth 1K words: lets generate state graphs (in the style of
the ICFP'12 paper) for the Church example (a) under baseline (b) with
lazy non-determinism (c) with compilation.  (Or a simpler example if
these are unweildy.)

Is there a rhyme or reason to the order in which the benchmarks are
presented?  Should there be?

Should we list the state SIZE as an evaluation metric and show
results?
