Which benchmarks were also evaluated in Soft Typing paper?

Look at the Jagannathan and Weeks paper and relate it in related work
section.

The CLU citation is missing some important bits.

The psuedoknot citation has bad characters in it.

Did Ian implement GC?

Need Cousot '79 citation.

Is there a rhyme or reason to the order in which the benchmarks are
presented?  Should there be?

Should we list the state SIZE as an evaluation metric and show
results?

Make sure to use \mathit for metafunction names.

Need a tighter citation for eval/app/cont.
